# codename-relocate
This is a project that will use scraped data and a homegrown algorithm to give people job openings in the LCOL areas of the country. It requires advanced data scraping techniques because unfortunately job websites guard their information closely, but thankfully I scraped from a website who scrapes other job websites so it's okay :)
